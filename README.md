Story
One of your best friends (Mary) who you've known for years has come to you for help.

Mary has always been obsessed with fantasy dragon card games, and she has recently set up a gaming company and her latest project is a new dragon card game being developed internally by a local group of enthusiasts (who are now her employees).

They don't have a website for their game yet. They have been doing everything manually, even drawing the cards themselves.

The problem is none of them are very tech savvy, which is why Mary reached out to you.

There is currently no way to look up card details online.

Mary has asked you to help her create a simple webpage that can shows all the dragon cards when the page loads, and to be able show any card and all of it's information by doing a simple search on a dragon name.

You don't even ask what budget she has, as you already know the answer. Zero.
